      <h2>Production Engineer Toolkit</h2>
      <p>
        To streamline and simplify the workflow of production engineers, we
        created a toolkit aimed at consolidating task management and report
        access into a single, user-friendly platform. Production engineers
        often face information overload due to fragmented tools and multiple
        reporting systems. By centralizing these elements, we aim to enhance
        productivity, improve information access, and ensure actionable tasks
        are tracked seamlessly.

      <h2>Problem Space</h2>
      <p class=" ">
        Production engineers receive tasks from disparate sources, including
        hard-to-track emails and various tools. Each task requires thorough
        review of multiple reports before a decision can be made.
      </p>
      <p class=" ">
        This fragmented workflow often leads to information overload, with
        engineers managing multiple open windows and tabs. Additionally,
        actions taken on tasks are rarely tracked, causing them to become lost
        to history and making it difficult to monitor progress.

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>
        The goal was to create a centralized application view where tasks,
        reports, and necessary tools are accessible in one place. This
        solution also had to meet business requirements for data tracking
        while respecting engineers' personalized workflows.

      <h2>Modal vs. Dedicated Page Design</h2>
      <p class="">
        The client initially preferred a modal to house all task details,
        reports, and actions in one place. Recognizing the limitations this
        would impose on usability and future scalability, I developed both a
        modal-based and a dedicated page design. By demonstrating the
        advantages of a separate page—clearer layout and capacity for
        growth—the client agreed this approach better aligned with long-term
        goals.

        alt="Modal-based design for task details, reports, and actions within the toolkit, displaying a compact, multi-section layout."
        class="rounded-lg my-4" onclick="openDialog('./../src/assets/toolkit_modal.png')">
      <p class="">
        Traditional modals are built for simple, isolated tasks, making it
        difficult to display complex, multi-section layouts. Key actions like
        dismiss, assign, and complete become hard to access, limiting
        scalability and creating a cluttered, unintuitive interface as new
        features are added.
      </p>
      <img src="./../src/assets/toolkit_page.png"
        alt="Dedicated page design showcasing a detailed layout with task information and actions, offering enhanced usability over the modal layout."
        class="rounded-lg my-4">
      <p class="">
        The dedicated page design provides a clear, spacious layout for
        displaying detailed task information and actions in one place,
        avoiding the cramped feel of a modal. Key actions like dismiss,
        assign, and complete are intuitively accessible, with room to add more
        features in the future. This layout enhances usability and supports
        scalability as the application grows.

      <h2>Impact and Feedback</h2>
      <p class="">
        Prototypes of the toolkit have received strong, positive feedback from
        both upper management and production engineers. There’s high
        anticipation for the product, with stakeholders expressing a desire
        for immediate release, underscoring the value and impact of this
        solution. Although the toolkit has not yet shipped, it is expected to
        launch in early 2025, with high expectations for improved efficiency
        and productivity.

      <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
      <p class="">
        One key challenge was coordinating with the team responsible for the
        existing system our toolkit needs to integrate with, as their
        priorities sometimes conflicted with ours. To expedite their work and
        help them address their backlog before reaching our integration needs,
        I created detailed design mockups and process flows for the necessary
        features. By clarifying requirements and providing visual references,
        I reduced back-and-forth communication, enabling their team to move
        faster and making it easier for them to support our integration.
